We would like to make a driving racing game like MarioCart, called Pingbin Cart. Pingbin is a Penguin and the main character of the game. There will also be another character called Bunny, who is a gray rabbit that you can choose to play as.

It is a 3D game, with a track that you can drive arround. For the first version of the game we can just have a very simple track that goes arround. But later we will want to make much more exciting tracks. Initially the track is flat, but in future we will want hilly tracks.

This is going to be a web-based game, built with React, TypeScript, and Three.js. Please use Vite to build the project. We could use React-three-fiber, but thats up to you - use whats best!

The controls should be the normal keyboard controlls for a racing game.

The game should have a simple UI with a start menu, a pause menu, and a settings menu.

For now there is no scoring, but in future we will want to add a scoring system.
